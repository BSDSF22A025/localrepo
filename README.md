## Project Description
This project demonstrates a simple webpage that displays the current date and time when a button is clicked. It also includes an image asset and basic styling using CSS. The JavaScript function is written in an external `.js` file, and all resources (HTML, CSS, JS, and images) are properly linked and organized.

## Instructions to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Ensure that all files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets) are in the same directory or follow the specified structure.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the webpage.
   
### File Structure:


## Tools and Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the webpage.

## Project Log
### Key Actions Taken:
- Created a basic HTML structure to display a heading, button, and paragraph.
- Wrote JavaScript to handle the button click event and display the current date and time in the paragraph.
- Separated the JavaScript functionality into an external `.js` file (`script.js`).
- Added an external CSS file (`style.css`) to style the button, text, and image on the webpage.
- Included an image asset in the project and linked it using an `<img>` tag in the HTML.
- Tested the project by opening `index.html` in multiple web browsers to ensure compatibility.

### Future Improvements:
- Add more interactivity, such as user input forms or additional dynamic content.
- Enhance the styling with more advanced CSS techniques, like animations or responsive design.
- Incorporate additional assets, such as fonts or icons.
